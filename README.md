# Countdown Timer
 
This repository includes Eagle CAD files for a two digit countdown timer based on 4029 counters.  The clock signal is adjustable with a 555 timer providing the pulses. The countdown amount is set by holding down a button.  Another button starts the countdown.  An Arduino sketch is included which can be used to set the timer and start the countdown.

The timer output switches states when the timer reaches 00.
